    <p>Nick and his colleague arrived exactly when they said they would, they worked cleanly, and efficiently and were really polite and helpful, I’d totally recommend Nick and have in fact done so all ready, and they only installed my stove on Monday!</p>

    <p>I am just writing to you to say a big thank I you for the fantastic job you did for my stove installation. From the moment I first called you through the final completion of work the service and quality of workmanship was outstanding. It wasn’t the most straightforward installation, however you overcame all problems with ease and consulted me throughout the process which was very reassuring.</p>
    <p>I am a director of a local electrical contracting company and and I know the importance of respecting customers’ home, it was great to see how you always cleaned up after yourself as you worked and always treated my home with the upmost respect.</p>

    <p>We were looking for someone to install a woodburner and found Nick’s details online. We decided to go with them after speaking with&nbsp;Nick who was very helpful and knowledgeble when discussing the job by telephone. Nick installed our woodburner, we found them thorough, professional and friendly. They took time to explain how to use and maintain our woodburner and gave us useful contacts for buying the woodburner, sweeping the chimney and wood delivery. They also raised our slate hearth (free of charge) which was something we hadn’t managed to do ourselves. We would not hesitate in recommending Nick to install your woodburner. Thanks again, we are looking forward to using it more! The stove looks brilliant and I am extremely grateful to you for the work you did. I would not hesitate to recommend you to other people who are thinking of having a stove installed in their home.</p>
